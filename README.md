# Lendo Frontend

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
git clone xxx
cd my_app
npm install
npm run dev
```

After installing dependencies with ```npm install```, start dev server with ```npm run dev``` which can be found on (localhost:3000).

## Stack
- Next.js (& React)
- Deployment via Vercel

## Reflection
Testing dynamic routes in Nextjs seemed to be the biggest obstable in this challenge.
